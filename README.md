## Creating a project

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server (`-- --host` hosts server on local network):

```bash
npm run dev -- --host
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
